## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed by a single developer. To enhance productivity and explore modern development workflows, AI assistance (powered by Google Gemini) was used for tasks such as code analysis, feature brainstorming, debugging, and generating boilerplate content. All core logic and final implementation were directed and written by the developer.
